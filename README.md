# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using real-world clinical data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. These are used to predict whether a patient has heart disease.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📁 Data loading and cleaning using `pandas`
- 📊 Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- ⚙️ Model training using `scikit-learn` classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
- 📈 Accuracy comparison of multiple models
- 🔄 Train-test splitting, normalization, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
